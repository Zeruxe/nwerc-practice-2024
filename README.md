NWERC 2024 Practice, JU Kod
===========================

There will be 4 different folders Yoseph,Calle,Adrian,Teacher/Rudy.
Then 1 folder to keep track of what needs to be done and what has been done. 

As soon as a problem is solved it will be updated in our "tracking" .txt file. 

This repo will ensure to keep track of our progress but mostly solutions of all the different problems in order to have pleasant code reviews during the meetings.

We will also try to follow the same filename manners through all the practioners to be able to identify which problem easier, perhaps just the plain name of the problem name.
